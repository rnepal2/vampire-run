Vampire uses the following main branches:

(maint): - updates for previous release
master: - current release in progress
new: - completed features for inclusion in release after next

new is a superset of master is a superset of maint. NEVER merge from maint to master or master to new!

New ideas should be developed in a dedicated branch forked from master for current release topics, and from new for release after next.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git checkout -b new_feature_name
git push origin new_feature_name

Once completed and tested this can be merged with new and staged for later inclusion with master. 

(on branch master"git merge new_feature")

At this point the initial development branch should be deleted.

Checkout remote branch to work on locally
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default git checks out master branch. To checkout another branch from the repository first create a 
local branch and then link to the original: 

git checkout -b local-name origin/remote-name
