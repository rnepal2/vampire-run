This program was used to run different instances of vampire script N times
to carry out ensemble avarage at finite temperature calculations. It forms 
N different directory with vampire input, material and ucf files and run them
in parallel in prescribed number of batches. More parameters can be varied 
by using the replace parameters in the program for other uses.

Used to calculate the magnon current correlators by using ensemble averaging 
instead of time averaging.
